## Retrieving the Dataset

The Yelp Dataset can be found on https://www.yelp.com/dataset or download it from the Google Drive link. The two main pieces of data that is needed to run our Spark queries are `yelp_academic_dataset_business.json` and `yelp_academic_dataset_review.json`.

## Running the Code:
For the ML model, PySpark queries, and visualizations, install the required dependencies using 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The frontend directory contains detailed information on how to run the web app / interactive map.
